//! # Resilient stanza stream
//!
//! This module provides the [`StanzaStream`], which is the next level up from
//! the low-level [`XmlStream`][`crate::xmlstream::XmlStream`].
//!
//! The stanza stream knows about XMPP and it most importantly knows how to
//! fix a broken connection with a reconnect and how to do this smoothly using
//! [XEP-0198 (Stream Management)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html).
//! XEP-0198 is only used if the peer supports it. If the peer does not
//! support XEP-0198, automatic reconnects are still done, but with more
//! undetectable data loss.
//!
//! The main API entrypoint for the stanza stream is, unsurprisingly,
//! [`StanzaStream`].

// stream reconnects. Keeping it may cause stanzas to be sent which weren't
// meant for that stream, replacing it is racy.
